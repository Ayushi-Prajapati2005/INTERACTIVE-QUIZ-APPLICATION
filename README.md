üéØ Quiz Web Application

This project is a feature-rich, interactive Quiz Web Application developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is designed to provide users with a simple, engaging, and informative platform to test their knowledge through a series of multiple-choice questions. The web app ensures an intuitive user experience by integrating guided instructions, seamless question navigation, instant feedback, and a dynamic result display.

The idea behind building this quiz app was to create a lightweight, browser-based solution for quick assessments or fun quizzes. Whether you're using it for self-assessment, classroom learning, or just casual trivia, this application delivers a user-friendly experience without the need for backend or database integration.

üåê Key Features

üìò Quiz Guide Popup

As soon as the user opens the quiz, they are welcomed with a Quiz Guide modal window. This popup is designed to set the expectations and rules before starting the quiz. It includes:

Guidelines encouraging honesty and fairness during the quiz attempt.

A reminder that no external help or cheating is allowed.

Explanation of the scoring method: each correct answer earns 1 point, with no negative marking.

Information about instant results ‚Äì the score is displayed immediately after the user completes the quiz.

The modal has two interactive buttons:

"Exit Quiz" ‚Äì lets the user opt out if they decide not to proceed.

"Continue" ‚Äì starts the quiz immediately.

üß† Interactive Quiz Interface

The core quiz interface is designed to be clean and accessible. Each question is shown one at a time, with four multiple-choice options. The user can select any one of the answers.

Upon selecting an option:

The correct answer is visually highlighted in green.

If the user chooses an incorrect option, it is marked in red.

This immediate feedback reinforces learning and helps users understand their mistakes.

Other elements of this section include:

A live score counter at the top-right corner (e.g., Score: 2 / 5).

A "Next" button to proceed to the next question.

Visual cues for the current question number, helping the user track progress (e.g., 4 of 5 Questions).

üìà Result Page

Once all the questions are answered, users are directed to the Result Page, which visually summarizes their performance. It includes:

A circular progress chart that displays the user's percentage score.

A textual representation of the result, such as Your Score: 2 out of 5.

Two action buttons:

"Try Again" ‚Äì reloads the quiz for another attempt.

"Go to Home" ‚Äì returns to the start or main menu.

This section uses animated transitions and smooth styling to make the end experience feel complete and rewarding.

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

HTML (HyperText Markup Language): Used to build the basic structure of the webpage, including elements like buttons, containers, questions, and options.

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets): Applied for designing and enhancing the visual appeal of the app. Features include gradient backgrounds, hover effects, button styling, modal animations, and responsive design to support different screen sizes.

JavaScript (JS): Powers the interactive functionality of the quiz. It handles logic such as:

Question switching

Answer checking

Score calculation

Real-time feedback
Result display

üìå Additional Notes

This is a fully client-side project ‚Äî no backend or database is used.
All quiz content is stored in the JavaScript file, which can be easily updated to add or change questions.
Ideal for educational mini-projects, personal portfolios, coding practice, or school assignments.
